## Log Level Distribution

### By Level:
- **BASIC**: 3 methods (14%) - Simple list operations, basic reads
- **DETAILED**: 13 methods (59%) - Most CRUD operations, relationship queries, validation
- **ADVANCED**: 6 methods (27%) - Security operations, business critical operations, scheduled jobs

### By Layer:
- **Controller**: 11 methods (50% BASIC, 36% DETAILED, 14% ADVANCED)
- **Service**: 10 methods (10% BASIC, 40% DETAILED, 50% ADVANCED)
- **Repository**: 9 methods (0% BASIC, 56% DETAILED, 44% ADVANCED)

## Security & Performance Features

### Security Considerations:
- Sensitive data sanitization enabled for authentication operations
- No logging of return values for authentication responses
- No logging of token values for security
- Email/username sanitization in arguments
- User data protection in collections

### Performance Thresholds:
- Authentication operations: 1500-2000ms
- Single entity reads: 300-500ms
- List operations: 1000-1500ms
- Status updates: 1500-2000ms
- Scheduled jobs: 8000-10000ms
- Token operations: 300-2000ms
- Repository queries: 500-2000ms

## Custom Tags Strategy

### Layer Tags:
- `layer=controller|service|repository` - Architectural layer identification
- `transaction=readonly|write` - Transaction type for database operations

### Security Tags:
- `security_operation=true` - Authentication and authorization operations
- `admin_operation=true` - Administrative functions requiring elevated permissions
- `auth_type=credentials|token` - Type of authentication mechanism
- `sanitization=true` - Operations with sensitive data handling

### Business Tags:
- `card_management=true` - Library card related operations
- `user_management=true` - User account operations
- `expiry_management=true` - Card expiration handling
- `renewal_operation=true` - Card renewal processes
- `status_change=true` - Entity status modifications

### Technical Tags:
- `scheduled_job=true` - Background scheduled operations
- `event_publishing=true` - Kafka event generation
- `messaging=true` - Message queue operations
- `async_operation=true` - Asynchronous processing
- `join_fetch=true` - Database queries with entity relationships

## Business Rules Covered

### Library Card Management:
- Card uniqueness validation (one active card per user)
- Expiry date management and validation
- Status change business rules (ACTIVE, EXPIRED, BLOCKED, LOST)
- Renewal eligibility validation
- Automated expiry processing

### User Management:
- Email/username uniqueness validation
- Role-based access control
- User registration with role assignment
- Authentication flow with token management

### Token Management:
- Refresh token lifecycle management
- Token expiry validation
- Cleanup of expired tokens
- Single active token per user policy

## Scheduled Operations

### Daily Processing:
1. **Expired Card Check** (00:00 daily):
   - Identifies and updates expired active cards
   - Sends expiry events for notification service
   - ADVANCED logging for audit trail

2. **Expiring Card Notifications** (01:00 daily):
   - Identifies cards expiring within configured timeframe
   - Sends notification events
   - ADVANCED logging for notification tracking

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Kafka Events:
- User registration events
- Library card lifecycle events (created, renewed, expired, expiring)
- All event publishing operations have ADVANCED logging
- Async operation monitoring with performance thresholds

## Testing & Monitoring

### Log Levels for Different Environments:
- **Development**: All levels enabled for debugging
- **Staging**: DETAILED and ADVANCED for integration testing
- **Production**: ADVANCED for critical operations, BASIC for monitoring

### Key Metrics Tracked:
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Card creation and renewal volumes
- Scheduled job execution times
- Token lifecycle metrics
- Database query performance

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies:
- Kafka message publishing with logging
- Database operations with performance monitoring
- Scheduled job execution tracking
- Token validation and cleanup processes

### API Endpoints Monitored:
- Authentication endpoints with security logging
- User management operations
- Library card CRUD operations
- Admin operations with audit trails

This implementation provides enterprise-grade observability for the user service with proper security handling, performance monitoring, and business intelligence capabilities.
